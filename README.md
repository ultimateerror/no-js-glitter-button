# No JS Animated Glitter Button

My wife wanted a glitter button, so I created this simple, animated button with 200 particles.

A very simple glitter button that is probably not ideal for production as it uses one element and one CSS rule for each particle .

## Task Description
- No JavaScript
- Glitter effect
- Rounded
- Colorful
- Animated
- Shiny

I know it's not perfect, and that's okay for me - at least for now. I just wanted to create it using simple techniques to make it as easy as possible to understand what's happening here.
